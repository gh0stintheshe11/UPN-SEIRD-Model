# Overview
This study investigates the influence of positive and negative information dissemination on SEIRD-like epidemics within multiplex networks, employing the UPN-SEIRD model. By considering distinct transmission and recovery rates for positive and negative information, we gain insight into the complex interplay between information and disease spread. Experimental setups, utilizing Barabási–Albert (BA) and Monte Carlo (MMC) simulations, validate our model’s predictions. Our findings highlight the significant role of information in shaping epidemic outcomes, providing valuable insights for public health strategies and epidemic control
